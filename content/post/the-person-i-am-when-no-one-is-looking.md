My [sister](http://www.kaileemcgee.com/) recently finished a short film, 'The Person I Am When No One Is Looking'. From the web site: "A confused LA filmmaker attempts to reshape her identity through a highly curated social media presence. As she blurs the line between fiction and reality, her public persona and true self become one."

It's a deeply personal film, and her best work yet. Check out the trailer embed above.
