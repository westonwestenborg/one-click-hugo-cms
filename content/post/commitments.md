I had some success with publicly committing to some things last year, and I am hoping that this year I can achieve the same.

My commitments this year are:

1. Read 40 books. I am taking suggestions.
2. Drink alcoholic beverages on <=26 days (that's an average of once every two weeks).
3. Write and publish something on this blog every single day. Short or long, on any topic.
4. Get better at Spanish. I still need to quantify this more precisely, and will report back on what I decide. It will likely be something like 'take 40 one-hour Spanish lessons' or something like that.
5. Hang out with Kelsey and Joe at least 13 times. I am always trying to get people to move to LA, and it has been a significant failure on my part to not spend more time with the people who have moved here.
6. Sleep better. I am going to buy a sleep tracker, come up with a measurable goal, and commit publicly in a future post.

I will update my progress on all of these here every month or two.

Happy 2019!!
